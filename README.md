AmiSocial (Ami = 'Me' / abv. of Amity) is a social media app which I made for my University (Amity University Kolkata). This project is based on MERN tech stack where I have used React for UI and Node js, MongoDb for Backend.
This is a responsive web application where anyone of my university who has access to this app link can login and explore all the features of it.
